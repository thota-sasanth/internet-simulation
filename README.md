# software-defined-network
The aim of this project is to create a SDN (Software Defined Network) using a tool called Mininet. Here, we built a network using a custom Topology and generated the routing tables for all the routers both statically and dynamically (using BIRD - Internet Routing Daemon). We also evaluated our network by calculating metrics such as bandwidth, delay, etc.
