# software-defined-network
The aim of this project is to create a SDN (Software Defined Network) using a tool called Mininet. The network is based on a custom Topology and the routing tables for all the routers were generated both statically and dynamically (using BIRD - Internet Routing Daemon). The custom network was also evaluated by calculating metrics such as bandwidth, delay, etc.
